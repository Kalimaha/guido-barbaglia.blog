# DIY Twitter with Redis and Ruby on Rails

[Redis](http://redis.io/) is a key-value in-memory database that was initially
released in 2009, and since then it gained great popularity. This kind of DB
is mainly used for real time analysis, counting and sorting problems, pub/sub,
queues and caching. In 2014, [Salvatore Sanfilippo](https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/pivotal-people/pivotal-people-salvatore-sanfilippo-inventor-of-redis)
(_the creator of Redis, a.k.a. [antirez](http://antirez.com/)_) published [a
very interesting post](http://redis.io/topics/twitter-clone) where he describes
the design and implementation of a Twitter clone based on Redis. This article
shows how Redis goes beyond the aforementioned use cases and how it could be
used as the primary data storage for an application. The original article is
intended to be a tutorial for newbies, so I will use it to learn and practice
with Redis. However, I will use [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
(_instead of PHP_) to implement the final web application. By doing so, I will
have the opportunity to approach a new technology and also to explore a new
scenario with Ruby on Rails. The application has been named _R3Twitter_ after
the technologies involved: Redis, Ruby and Rails.

## The brain: Redis

Antirez’s post provides a detailed overview of Redis commands and also explains
more in depth the design of the application, so for more details please refer
to the [original post](http://redis.io/topics/twitter-clone).

<hr>

## Unique IDs

Redis provides the `INCR` command, an atomic operator used to increment a
counter in a concurrent environment. This means that when multiple clients try
to modify the same variable at the same time, this will be protected by
simultaneous accesses for the time required for the update, keeping the value
of the variable consistent. _R3Twitter_ requires two entities: `users` and
`tweets`, therefore we need two different counters. The `user_id` counter can
be simply generated as follows:

<hr>

```bash
INCR user_id
```

Such counter can be retrieved at any time:

```bash
GET user_id
```

The same concepts can be obviously applied for `tweet_id`.

<hr>

## Users and Tweets

Once the mechanism required to generate unique IDs is in place, it is possible
to store both the users and the tweets. `HMSET` is the Redis way to associate a
key (_e.g. `user_id` or `tweet_id`_) to an object in the DB. The user having
`user_id` "_42_" can be stored in the DB as follows:

<hr>

```bash
HMSET user:42 username "kalimaha" password "12345678"
```

Similarly, a tweet posted by the previous user having `tweet_id` "_1982_" will
be saved like this:

``bash
HMSET tweet:1982 user "42" time "1460935326" body "Hello, World!"

````

For login purposes, it is also required to keep track of the mapping between
the username and its internal ID. The set named users will hold such
relationship:

```bash
HSET users "kalimaha" "42"
````

The login process can be charted as follows:

<img class="mx-auto d-block" src="/images/r3twitter_01.webp" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Diagram" style="background-color: #fdf5eb;" />

<hr>

## Followers

Each user has a list of followers, and a list of followings. The first list
will be used to update other users timelines, while the latter can be used to
keep track of the user’s network. Such lists can be implemented either as a set
or as an ordered set. We will use the latter to keep track of the changes of
the two networks over time. `ZADD` allows you to create an ordered list through
the use of a score, which is a value that defines the priority of an item over
another. The followers list can be created using a timestamp as the score value
as follows:

```bash
ZADD followers:42 "1460935326" "27"
```

Where "_1460935326_" is the score and "_27_" is the hypothetical ID of another
user (_a follower_). In case we decide to follow "_27_" back, we need to update
the following list as well:

```bash
ZADD following:27 "1460935326" "42"
```

<hr>

## Timeline

The timeline of an user is simply a list of tweets made by the people the user
is currently following. To add a tweet to the user’s timeline we will use
`LPUSH`, which adds an item at the top of a list:

```bash
LPUSH timeline:42 "1982"
```

The tweet having `tweet_id` "_42_" has been added to the author’s timeline
because usually the Twitter timeline also shows your own updates. To retrieve
the list of tweets, simply execute:

```bash
LRANGE timeline:42 0 -1
```

The two parameters at the end, 0 and -1, define the starting and ending point
of the list’s portion we are retrieving, and these can be used to paginate the
query’s result (_e.g. show the latest 100 tweets only_).

<hr>

## The muscle: Ruby on Rails

[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) (_RoR_) is a web framework based on
the Ruby programming language, it follows the MVC (_Model-View-Controller_)
pattern, and it is heavily centered on the resources and the CRUD operations
that it is possible to perform on them. This project is based on Redis,
which is a key-value DB, so we can’t really map our resources on RoR models,
therefore we need to find another way to manage our simple models: user and
tweet. The first thing to do then is to get rid of the
[Active Record](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)
feature of RoR. To do so, we need to specify the `-O` option during the project
creation:

```bash
rails new R3Twitter -O
```

It is also possible to remove the Active Record in a later stage, but it’s
much better to start with the right foot, trust me! The project has no models,
and we will organize the back-end in controllers, which deal with the
communication with the views, and helpers, which encapsulate the
communication with the DB.

<hr>

## Communicate with Redis: helpers

Helpers are Ruby modules that can be imported in the controllers. In the
current structure of the projects there are three different `_helper` modules:
`application`, `user` and `tweet`. The `application_helper` implements the
business logic required to open a connection with the DB, and it also contains
all the methods of general utility:

```ruby
module ApplicationHelper
  attr_reader :redis

  @redis = nil

  def init_redis
    @redis = Redis.new(:host => Rails.configuration.x.redis.host,
                       :port => Rails.configuration.x.redis.port,
                       :password => Rails.configuration.x.redis.password) if @redis == nil
  end

  # Empty the DB. This method is used in the testing environment.
  def flushdb
    keys = @redis.keys('*')
    @redis.del(*keys) unless keys.empty?

    'OK'
  end
end
```

Both the `user_helper` and the `tweet_helper` extend the `application_helper`
in order to use the connector that access the DB. Each helper then contains the
methods required to manage users and tweets at the Redis level
(_e.g. generate unique ID’s, create a user, retrieve tweets, and so forth_).

<hr>

## Communicate with users: controllers

Controllers are in charge of collecting the parameters from the views, process
the business logic, and render the views. Once again there are three different
controller: the `application_controller` is in charge of initializing the
helpers, while `user` and `tweet` controller implement the business logic for
our models. The application_controller is as simple as:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protect_from_forgery with: :exception

  before_action :initialize_helper

  skip_before_filter :verify_authenticity_token

  def initialize_helper
    init_redis
  end
end
```

<hr>

## Deploy on Heroku

To deploy on Heroku, we need to provide a configuration file, install Redis,
and configure the app to work with the cloud DB.

<hr>

## Procfile

The first step we need to take to deploy our project on Heroku is a
`Procfile` stored in the project’s root. Such file is plain simple:

```yaml
web: bundle exec rails server -p $PORT
```

<hr>

## Add Redis

After that, we need to change the default Heroku DB, from PostgreSQL to Redis.
To do so, create an app in Heroku, then remove the PostgreSQL service from
_Resources_ / _Add-ons_. Then, in the same section, search and select
_Heroku Redis_.

<hr>

## Different settings for different environments

During the development and testing phase it is possible to use the Redis
instance running in localhost. However, for the production environment we need
to connect the application to the Redis instance running in the Heroku cloud.
To do so, we are required to specify the host, the port and the password. To
acquire such information I will use the Heroku CLI:

```yaml
heroku config:get REDIS_URL --app r3twitter
```

<hr>

The result is in the form:

```bash
redis://h:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:<PORT>
```

RoR come with three different environment (_development, production and
testing_), and each one of these environments has its own configuration file
located at `config/environments`. We need to add the Redis settings at the end
of each one of these files. For example, the `development.rd` file will look
like:

```ruby
Rails.application.configure do
  # Other stuff
  ...

  # Rails instance
  config.x.redis.host = 'localhost'
  config.x.redis.port = 6379
  config.x.redis.password = nil
end
```

These settings are used in the `init` method of the aforementioned
`application_helper` file:

```ruby
def init_redis
  @redis = Redis.new(:host => Rails.configuration.x.redis.host,
                     :port => Rails.configuration.x.redis.port,
                     :password => Rails.configuration.x.redis.password) if @redis == nil
end
```

<hr>

## Deploy

We are almost there! Now we just need to connect the Heroku app to the GitHub
repository and deploy it. All these operations can be performed through the web
interface. Et voilá, we can finally tweet our first message!

<img class="mx-auto d-block" src="/images/r3twitter_02.webp" width="50%" height="50%" alt="Example" style="background-color: #fdf5eb;" />

<hr>

## Continuous integration

We can easily link our GitHub project to the continuous integration platform
TravisCI. To do so, we just need a `.travis.yml` file in the project’s root.
The file is as simple as:

```yaml
language: ruby

rvm:
  - 2.2

services:
  - redis-server

script:
  - bundle exec rake test

bundler_args: --binstubs=./bundler_stubs

after_success:
  - coveralls
```

<hr>

## Conclusions

This post, based on an article by Salvatore Sanfilippo, describes how to
implement a simple Twitter clone built with Ruby on Rails using Redis as the
main DB. The data structure has been easily implemented in Redis with very
few functions. RoR has been used to implement the web app by removing the
default Active Record feature and mapping the Redis functionalities by means of
Ruby modules. Finally, the app has been deployed on Heroku, removing the default
PostgreSQL storage and installing the Redis DB.
