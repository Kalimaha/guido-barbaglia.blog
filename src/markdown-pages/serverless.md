# Create a full-stack serverless web-app with a single file

Serverless is one of the biggest buzzwords of these years, and the
implementation of solutions based on such architecture has been boosted by the
release of AWS Lambda. This post describes a little experiment I conducted to
learn more about this technology. I wanted to define and deploy a fully
functional web-app _(both back-end and front-end)_ based on RESTful services
with **one single file**. The web-app itself is a very simple guestbook, that
allows users to post short messages and read what other users previously posted.
The app consists of a simple HTML client with some JQuery in it, and two Python
RESTful services used to retrieve and create messages. This simple architecture
is shown in the picture below.

Through the use of AWS CloudFormation it is possible to configure, create,
deploy and orchestrate all these resources with a single file. The source code
of the Serverless Guestbook experiment is available on GitHub at
[this link](https://github.com/Kalimaha/serverless-guestbook).

## What is serverless anyway?

According to Martin Fowler:

_Serverless can [â€¦] mean applications where some amount of server-side logic is
still written by the application developer but unlike traditional architectures
is run in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may
only last for one invocation), and fully managed by a 3rd party.

In the Serverless Guestbook experiment, the entire source code of the
server-side logic is defined in the configuration file. I don't know anything
about the deployment and management of my Lambda functions, which are stateless
and event triggered. What is more, I don't know any details of the management
and deployment of any of the components of my architecture: the DB, the gateway,
and so forth. Let's start!

<hr>

## Data Storage

The first piece of the system is the data storage. I only need one table to
store the guestbook messages. I will then define a new DynamoDB resource in my
CloudFormation file as follows:

```yaml
DB:
Type: "AWS::DynamoDB::Table"
  Properties:
    TableName: Messages
    AttributeDefinitions:
      - AttributeName: MessageID
        AttributeType: S
    KeySchema:
      - AttributeName: MessageID
        KeyType: HASH
    ProvisionedThroughput:
      ReadCapacityUnits: 5
      WriteCapacityUnits: 5
```

DynamoDB is schema-less, I only need to define the name of the table
_(`Messages`)_, and a single attribute that will be used as the primary key
_(`MessageID`)_. We will store more information in the DB, but AWS doesn't need
to know about it.

<hr>

## Front-end

<hr>

### S3 web-site hosting

The front-end has only one element, a simple HTML page with some JavaScript
code embedded into it. S3 is a simple storage service that can be easily
configured to serve static content. The bucket can be created as follows:

```yaml
S3Bucket:
  Type: "AWS::S3::Bucket"
  Properties:
    BucketName: serverless-guestbook
    AccessControl: PublicRead
    WebsiteConfiguration:
      IndexDocument: index.html
```

I will use a policy to configure the S3 to serve our static page:

```yaml
S3BucketPolicy:
  Type: "AWS::S3::BucketPolicy"
  Properties:
   Bucket: !Ref S3Bucket
   PolicyDocument:
     Statement:
       - Sid: PublicReadForGetBucketObjects
         Effect: Allow
         Principal: "*"
         Resource:
           - "arn:aws:s3:::serverless-guestbook/*"
         Action:
           - "s3:GetObject"
```

<hr>

### HTML and JavaScript

The HTML page defines a simple form and a list of messages retrieved from the
DB. The source code is available here and the UI is shown below.

<img class="mx-auto d-block" src="/images/serverless_guestbook_02.webp" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Diagram 2" style="background-color: #fdf5eb;" />

<hr>

### Populate the Bucket

I defined an S3 bucket capable to serve static content. I also have an HTML
client for my services. How do I link the two, in the same file? Can I populate
the bucket after its creation with the HTML client? The easiest thing is to use
the `putObject` method of the AWS NodeJS SDK. Such method takes a string _(the
whole source code of the front-end in this case)_ and creates a file in the
given bucket. At this point I need something to execute this source code,
therefore I need to define a Lambda function, as describe at
[line 31](https://github.com/Kalimaha/serverless-guestbook/blob/master/stack.yml#L31)
of the CloudFormation file.

<hr>

### Trigger the Lambda

I have a Lambda function capable to put the HTML code in the S3 bucket. But
this is just the description of a function, I need something to trigger such
function. To achieve such goal, it is possible to define a `CustomResource`,
which:

_enable you to write custom provisioning logic in templates that AWS
CloudFormation runs anytime you create, update (if you changed the custom
resource), or delete stacks_

Basically, after the CloudFormation stack has been created, AWS triggers the
custom resource, which is linked to the Lambda. Its definition is very simple:

```yaml
CustomResourcePopulateS3:
  Type: "Custom::PopulateS3"
  Version: 1.0
  Properties:
    ServiceToken: !GetAtt [ LambdaPopulateS3, Arn ]
```

Please note that the custom resource needs to receive a response from the
Lambda function that has been triggered. AWS provides a JavaScript library for
the NodeJS SDK. Such library must be imported in the Lambda function:

```javascript
var response = require('cfn-response');
```

And then it is invoked at the end of the Lambda function to send a response to
the custom resource:

```javascript
s3.putObject(params, function(err, data) {
  if (err)  response.send(event, context, response.FAILURE, data)
  else      response.send(event, context, response.SUCCESS, data)
})
```

The CustomResource mechanism is summarized in the image below:

## Back-end

### Create and Retrieve Data

The business logic of the whole application is composed by two RESTful services:
a `GET` request to fetch all the messages from the DB, and a `POST` call to
create a new message. I can define a Lambda function for each service, and each
function will use the AWS SDK to query the DynamoDB table. I have previously
used the NodeJS SDK to populate the S3 bucket to take advantage of the
`cfn-response` library, but I will pick the Python SDK to communicate with the
DB. The `GET` function retrieves and sort all the messages in the table:

```yaml
LambdaGet:
  Type: "AWS::Lambda::Function"
  Properties:
    FunctionName: GetMessages
    Handler: index.handler
    Role: !GetAtt [ LambdaFunctionRole, Arn ]
    Runtime: python2.7
    Code:
      ZipFile: >
        import boto3
        def handler(event, context):
          messages = []
          db_client = boto3.client('dynamodb')
          items = db_client.scan(TableName='Messages', Select='ALL_ATTRIBUTES')['Items']
          for item in items:
            messages.append({
              'message': item['Message']['S'],
              'author': item['Author']['S'],
              'date': item['Date']['S']
            })
          return sorted(messages, key=lambda msg: msg['date'], reverse=True)
```

On the other hand, the `POST` function reads the message and the author from
the front-end, generates the ID and the date, and finally stores the new
message in the DB:

```yaml
LambdaPost:
  Type: "AWS::Lambda::Function"
  Properties:
    FunctionName: PostMessage
    Handler: index.handler
    Role: !GetAtt [ LambdaFunctionRole, Arn ]
    Runtime: python2.7
    Code:
      ZipFile: >
        import boto3, datetime, uuid
        def handler(event, context):
          db_client = boto3.client('dynamodb')
          response = db_client.put_item(
            TableName = 'Messages',
            Item = {
              'MessageID': { 'S': uuid.uuid1().urn },
              'Message': { 'S': event['message'] },
              'Author': { 'S': event['author'] },
              'Date': { 'S': datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat() }
            }
          )
          return response
```

### API

Lambda functions are ready to be executed, but I need to expose them as API to
be able to use them from the front-end. This part is a bit verbose, because I
need to define several resources, such as an API Account to be able to use
CloudWatch logs. I then need to define an API Gateway, a gateway role to grant
permissions to my API, and finally a deployment and a stage. For each Lambda
function I also need to define a method. For example, the `GET` method is
defined as follows:

```yaml
GetMessagesREST:
  Type: "AWS::ApiGateway::Method"
  Properties:
    AuthorizationType: NONE
    HttpMethod: GET
    Integration:
      Credentials: !GetAtt [ APIGatewayRole, Arn ]
      IntegrationHttpMethod: POST
      IntegrationResponses:
        - StatusCode: 200
          ResponseParameters:
            method.response.header.Access-Control-Allow-Headers: "'Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token'"
            method.response.header.Access-Control-Allow-Methods: "'GET,OPTIONS'"
            method.response.header.Access-Control-Allow-Origin: "'*'"
      Type: AWS
      PassthroughBehavior: WHEN_NO_MATCH
      Uri:
        !Join
          - ""
          -
            - "arn:aws:apigateway:ap-southeast-2:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/"
            - !GetAtt [ LambdaGet, Arn ]
            - "/invocations"
    MethodResponses:
      - StatusCode: 200
        ResponseParameters:
          method.response.header.Access-Control-Allow-Headers: false
          method.response.header.Access-Control-Allow-Methods: false
          method.response.header.Access-Control-Allow-Origin: false
    ResourceId: !GetAtt [ APIGateway, "RootResourceId" ]
    RestApiId: !Ref APIGateway
```

This type of resource defines the HTTP method, the inputs, the outputs, the
integration with the Lambda function and the headers of each REST service. Such
headers are very important to define CORS filters and be able to consume such
services from the front-end. To summarize, the following resources are required:

* [API Gateway Account](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-account.html)
* [API Gateway REST API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-restapi.html)
* [API Gateway Deployment](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-deployment.html)
* [API Gateway Stage](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-stage.html)
* [API Gateway Method](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-method.html)

## Conclusions

Well, I made it! I was able to define, deploy and orchestrate an entire fully
functional web-app based on RESTful service with a single file! To begin with,
I have created a schemaless DB with a single table. Then I defined an S3 bucket
to host my static content, and a Lambda function _(triggered by a custom
resource)_ to populate such bucket when the stack is created. Defining the
whole front-end client inline inside a Lambda function was a bit of a stretch
of course, but I wanted to put everything in **ONE** file! After that, I had to
configure the whole environment for my API: an account, a deployment, a stage
and an endpoint for each service. Finally, I implemented two different Lambda
functions capable to query the DB. The whole experiment was quite interesting,
and the final result is not too bad. I expected the Lambda functions to be slow
_(especially after long periods of non-usage of the service)_, but I have
experienced a better response time compared to Heroku's Dynos. The development
process is quite long and painful, because the only way to test the stack is to
deploy it and try the various components, especially their interactions. The
`CustomResource` is particularly fragile, and any error in the usage of the
`cfn-response` library will lead to a huge waste of time. On the other hand,
this could be an interesting way to prototype simple apps and experiment with
different technologies and setups. For example, I have used two different SDK's 
_(NodeJS and Python)_ for two different use cases in the same project. What is
more, you don't have to worry about any ops settings, because AWS will manage
almost everything for you!
