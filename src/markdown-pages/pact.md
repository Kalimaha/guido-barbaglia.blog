# Consumer-driven contract testing with Pact and Python

Today microservices play a very important role, as they have become the
architecture of choice for many companies. The web is full of articles and talks
about the amazing advantages of this architecture, e.g.:

- Faster time to market
- Smaller teams
- Ease of maintainance
- Independent scalability of components
- Independent choice of programming languages

and so forth and so on. Nothing in life is free of course, and all these amazing
features have a cost. First and foremost your company will probably experience
an exponential growth of microservices, and you may end up with
[something like this](https://goo.gl/cZnhZi)... With such a proliferation of
services, how can you ensure the correct behaviour of your platform? How do you
manage breaking changes between consumers and providers? There are many answers
to these questions, but let's consider two of them.

<hr>

## Provider-Driven Contracts

A way to establish some order in the far-west of your services is to create a
"_contract_" between a provider and its consumers. If we make a real life
example, we may consider a restaurant as a service provider and hungry people
as its natural consumers. The contract between the restaurant and its customers
is clearly represented by, well, the menu! By reading the menu, consumers know
exactly which services they can access and which are the rules regulating such
services (_e.g. price, suitability for vegetarians, etc._). Going back to
microservices, we can build a restaurant service that exposes a "_contract_"
(_in JSON format_) that other services can access in order to build and verify
their interactions in terms of endpoints, payloads and responses. There are many
ways to implement such a contract, e.g. [through the JSON Schema specification](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/spe.2466/full).

<hr>

## Consumer-Driven Contracts

A different approach is represented by consumer-driven contracts: service
consumers define the contract between them and their providers, and providers
must honour such contracts. The first time I heard of this approach I thought:
"_Well, this is stupid!_". I can't walk into a restaurant, define my own menu
and expect the restaurant to provide what I want! Well, let's be a little bit
more open minded and consider the following image:

<img class="mx-auto d-block" src="/images/classic_kitchen_brigade.webp" width="90%" height="90%" alt="Classic kitchen brigade" style="background-color: #fdf5eb;" />

<br>

A kitchen brigade can be seen as a collection of microservices that need to
cooperate in order to produce the final output. In this situation it makes a lot
of sense for one microservice, e.g. the `SousChefService`, to define a contract
with its providers, e.g. the `RoastChefService`. The correct behaviour of the
overall architecture is ensured because every service must honour contracts with
its consumers, and breaking changes are detected (_and possibly avoided, or at
least discussed_) as soon as they happen. How to achieve that? A possible
implementation of this pattern is represented by Pact, a framework that provides
support for consumer-driven contract testing.

## Pact

Pact is based on simple JSON files that allow interoperability between
programming languages. The examples in the next sections use a Python
implementation of the Pact framework, but the base concepts are the same. Pact
tests have two phases: provider test and consumer test. Such phases are
"_asynchronous_" and do not require real interactions between the two systems.
In the initial phase, the consumer defines its expectations about one or more
interactions with a provider. For example, the consumer defines what payload it
will send and what the expected response is. Such expectations are verified
locally against a mock server, generating (_when successful_) a JSON file
(_the pact_). This modus operandi represents a sort of "_TDD for services_",
because developers can define the interaction first, and develop the
`repositories/controllers` based on the responses of the mock server, with no
need for real HTTP interactions. In the second phase, the provider re-plays the
interactions recorded in the Pact file and verifies that the expectations are
met. Pact files can be stored in the provider's codebase or obtained through a
Pact Broker that acts as a "_middle-man_" between consumers and providers. What
about an example at this point?

## Establish the contract

Let's consider the scenario where the Sous Chef relies on the Grill Chef to cook
the steaks that he will then garnish and send to the clients. Such a situation
can be described with a test:

```python
@service_consumer('Sous Chef')
@has_pact_with('Grill Chef')
class GrillChefTest(ServiceProviderTest):

    @given('steaks are available')
    @upon_receiving('a request for a steak')
    @with_request({'method': 'POST', 'path': '/steaks/', 'body': {'cooking': 'medium-rare'}})
    @will_respond_with({'status': 201, 'body': {'waitingTime': 10}})
    def test_steak(self):
        response = GrillChefRepository.steak('medium-rare')
        assert response['waitingTime'] == 10
```

Let's break down this test to understand how it works. The first bit is the
definition of the class:

```python
@service_consumer('Sous Chef')
@has_pact_with('Grill Chef')
class GrillChefTest(ServiceProviderTest):
    pass
```

The class itself extends `ServiceProviderTest`, provided by the Pact library. It
also identifies the consumer (`@service_consumer('Sous Chef')`) and the provider
(`@has_pact_with('Grill Chef')`). Each class will generate a single pact file
that contains one or more interactions. Each method in the class describes an
interaction and has a setup section, which configures the mock server and the
test itself. The setup of the interaction requires the following:

- **given:** the pre-condition to the test that tells the provider how to set the initial state for this interaction. For example, this may require storing some dummy data in the DB before executing the test.
- **upon_receiving:** a description of the interaction.
- **with_request:** the payload that the consumer will send to the provider. The test itself will fail if the request is different from the one declared in the setup.
- **will_respond_with:** the expected response from the provider.

The resulting Pact file for this interaction is the following:

```json
{
  "provider": { "name": "Grill Chef" },
  "consumer": { "name": "Sous Chef" },
  "interactions": [
    {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "providerState": "steaks are available",
      "description": "a request for a steak",
      "request": {
        "body": { "cooking": "medium-rare" },
        "path": "/steaks/",
        "query": "",
        "method": "POST",
        "headers": []
      },
      "response": {
        "body": { "waitingTime": 10 },
        "status": 201,
        "headers": []
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Pact tests can be used to verify all scenarios of interest, such as wrong
requests or internal error. For example, the following example covers the case
of a `4xx` HTTP error code, and it will add a new entry to the interactions
section of our pact file:

```python
@given('steaks are available')
@upon_receiving('a request for a well-done steak')
@with_request({'method': 'POST', 'path': '/steaks/', 'body': {'cooking': 'well-done'}})
@will_respond_with({'status': 422, 'body': {'reason': 'we do not serve well-done steaks'}})
def test_steak(self):
    response = steak('well-done')
    assert response.status_code == 422
```

<br>

Once we're happy with the interactions, we can send the pact file to the Pact
Broker to streamline the whole process, or simply store it in the provider's
codebase for verification.

<hr>

## Honour your contracts

We must now make sure that the provider honours his pacts with the consumers.
The test looks like this:

```python
@honours_pact_with('Sous Chef')
@pact_uri('http://localhost:9292/pacts/provider/Grill%20Chef/consumer/Sous%20Chef/latest.json')
class SousChef(ServiceConsumerTest):

    @state('steaks are available')
    def test_steak(self):
        DB.save(Steak(cooked=False))
```

Pact file can be obtained either through a URL or local file, and its location
is defined with the `pact_uri` decorator. We then need to define a state for
each `given` condition that has been defined by the consumer. In the previous
section we defined two different interactions, but they're both based on the
same pre-condition: "_steaks are available_". States are used to prepare the
system to run the test, e.g. store some dummy data in the test DB. The provider
is now able to re-play the interactions stored in the pact file and verify that
everything goes as expected. During this phase, the pact library will actually
start the service, make the requests defined in the pact, and verify the
responses against the expectations. The provider is therefore required to define
a `pact_helper.py` file that is capable to start and stop the service. The
following is a simple implementation with Gunicorn:

```python
class GrillChefPactHelper(PactHelper):
    test_port = 8080
    process = None

    def setup(self):
        cmd = 'gunicorn start:app -w 3 -b :8080 --log-level error'
        self.process = subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True)

    def tear_down(self):
        self.process.kill()
```

## Conclusions

Pact is a framework that implements the consumer-driven contract testing
pattern. It can be used to verify the interactions between "_internal_" services,
where "_internal_" means that you have control over the consumers and the
providers (_you can try to write a consumer test for Google Maps, not sure
whether they will commit to honour it though!_). This technique may reduce the
need for costly integration tests and give you more confidence about the overall
behaviour of your systems. Pact tests can be run as part of your testing pipeline
and are quite fast. But, how can pact tests prevent breaking changes??? Well,
they can't! But the real value added of this integration strategy is the fact
that it fosters conversations and collaboration between teams. Whenever you need
to introduce a breaking change as a provider, you can immediately verify which
are the consumers that will be affected by the change, and initiate a process
that involves both teams with the final goal of keeping your platform up,
running and healthy.
